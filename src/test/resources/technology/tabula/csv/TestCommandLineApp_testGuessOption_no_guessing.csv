"E-PRTR pollutants and their thresholds"
""
"A facility has to report data under E-PRTR if it fulfils the following criteria:"
"• the facility falls under at least one of the 65 E-PRTR economic activities. The"
"activities are also reported using a statistical classification of economic activities"
"(NACE rev 2)"
"• the facility has a capacity exceeding at least one of the E-PRTR capacity"
"thresholds"
"• the facility releases pollutants or transfers waste off-site which exceed specific"
"thresholds set out in Article 5 of the E-PRTR Regulation. These thresholds for"
"releases of pollutants are specified for each media - air, water and land - in Annex"
"II of the E-PRTR Regulation."
